# Hey there 👋 I'm Danyl

🎸 I'm an aspiring musician & passionate Machine Learning enthusiast from India, currently exploring how intelligent systems and creativity can blend to build real impact.

🧠 My current focus lies heavily in the field of **AI/ML**, especially in the areas of deep learning, hybrid model architectures, and multimodal intelligence. From detecting deepfakes to designing predictive models using LSTM-BERT, I love building systems that *learn*, *adapt*, and *solve*.

💻 I'm also hands-on with **Python**, **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch**, and dabbling in the ML pipeline across data scraping, preprocessing, and inference — always pushing the limits of what’s possible with limited hardware.

🎶 When I’m not coding, I’m playing piano or working on new music — trying to create harmony between tech and art. I believe that the logic of machine learning and the rhythm of music can coexist in powerful ways.

🔍 Fascinated by:
- Financial Markets & Predictive Modeling
- High-performance AI like AlphaZero and AlphaFold
- Bridging the gap between Machine Learning and Real Life
- Biotech x AI: Merging intelligent systems with biology
- Building autonomous systems that *learn*, *reason*, and *act*


⚙️ Currently building hybrid AI systems and exploring how models like AlphaZero and GPT can power smarter tools — while always trying to sneak in a jam session on the side.
